# CLAUDE.md - Dead Ahead: Roadkill Bingo

## Project Overview
Dead Ahead: Roadkill Bingo is a React Native/Expo mobile game where players spot bizarre roadside sights during road trips using a 5Ã—5 bingo grid. The game combines dark British humor with interactive gameplay, featuring a camera integration for "Snap-a-Roadkill" photo sharing and leaderboards.

## Game Architecture

### Core Game Logic (`src/stores/gameStore.ts`)
- **BingoCell Interface**: Represents each tile with position, spotted state, and tile data
- **GameState Interface**: Complete game state including grid, settings, stats
- **Win Conditions**: 
  - Standard mode: 3-in-a-row
  - Savage mode: 5-in-a-row
  - Checks rows, columns, and diagonals
- **Grid Generation**: 5Ã—5 grid with center "Free Range" tile always spotted

### Tile System (`src/data/tiles.ts`)
- **33 unique tiles** across 6 categories:
  - ROADKILL (11 tiles) - dark humor content
  - VEHICLES (7 tiles) - cars, trucks, trailers
  - ROADSIDE (7 tiles) - litter, lost items
  - PEOPLE (3 tiles) - human activities
  - INFRASTRUCTURE (4 tiles) - road features
  - SPECIAL (1 tile) - center "Free Range" tile
- **Rarity system**: Common (60%), Uncommon (30%), Rare (10%)
- **Dark humor filter**: Optional content filtering for sensitive tiles

### Theme System (`src/unistyles.ts`)
- Light/Dark theme support with adaptive switching
- Color scheme: Red (#FF4444) primary, Gold (#FFD700) secondary
- Responsive breakpoints (xs, sm, md, lg, xl)
- Platform-specific styling capabilities

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm start
npx expo start

# Platform-specific builds
npm run android        # Android development build
npm run ios           # iOS development build
npm run web           # Web development build

# Development tools
npm run lint          # ESLint code checking
npm run reset-project # Reset to blank Expo template

# Build for production
npx expo build        # Production builds (requires EAS)
```

## Current Development Status

### Implemented
- âœ… Project scaffolding with Expo Router
- âœ… Zustand game store with complete game logic
- âœ… Comprehensive tile system with 33 game tiles
- âœ… Unistyles theming system
- âœ… Win condition algorithms (3-in-a-row, 4-in-a-row)
- âœ… Settings system (sound, haptics, dark humor filter)
- âœ… Game statistics tracking
- âœ… All game assets (tile images)
- âœ… Camera integration for photo capture
- âœ… Instagram API integration for photo sharing

### TODO (Per PDR.md)
- ðŸš§ Replace template screens with actual game UI
- ðŸš§ Implement 5Ã—5 bingo grid component
- ðŸš§ Build leaderboard with image upload
- ðŸš§ Implement sound effects and haptic feedback
- ðŸš§ Create settings screen
- ðŸš§ Add card gallery for previous games
- ðŸš§ Add game tutorial/onboarding screens
- ðŸš§ Implement user statistics and achievements display

## Key Configuration Files

### `app.json`
- Bundle IDs: `com.anonymous.deadaheadbingo`
- New Architecture enabled
- Portrait orientation only
- Expo Router and Splash Screen plugins

### `babel.config.js`
- Unistyles plugin with `src` root
- Reanimated plugin for animations
- Expo preset configuration

### `tsconfig.json`
- Strict TypeScript mode
- Path aliases: `@/*` maps to project root
- Expo TypeScript base configuration

## Assets & Resources

### Game Assets (`assets/images/`)
- 30+ PNG tile images (dead animals, vehicles, roadside items)
- App icons and splash screens
- Logo assets (`dead_ahead_logo.png`, `free_range_logo_square.jpg`)

### Notable Dependencies
- **expo-camera**: For roadkill photo capture
- **expo-haptics**: Tactile feedback
- **expo-image**: Optimized image loading
- **react-native-gesture-handler**: Touch interactions
- **react-native-webview**: Web content display

## Development Tips

1. **Game State**: Use `useGameStore()` hook to access/modify game state
2. **Theming**: Import and use Unistyles for consistent styling
3. **Assets**: All tile images are already imported in `tiles.ts`
4. **Navigation**: Use Expo Router file-based routing in `app/` directory
5. **Platform Support**: Project supports iOS, Android, and web simultaneously

## Architecture Notes

- **File-based routing**: Screens go in `app/` directory
- **Component organization**: Reusable components in `src/components/`
- **Store pattern**: Zustand store handles all game state management
- **Theme system**: Unistyles provides responsive, platform-aware styling
- **Asset management**: Images bundled via `require()` statements

## PDR Reference
See `PDR.md` for complete product requirements, game rules, content categories, and development milestones. The technical implementation closely follows the PDR specifications with modern React Native/Expo architecture.
