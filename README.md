    ```

    In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:
    *   [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
    *   [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
    *   [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
    *   [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

    You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
