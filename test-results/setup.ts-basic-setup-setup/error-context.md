Thousands of animals are killed every week, and spotting them can help conservation efforts. Want to help? Log your sightings with the Mammals on Roads app by the People's Trust for Endangered Species. Every report helps track wildlife populations and improve road safety.  App Store: PTES Mammals on Roads"
