# Issue Reproduction & Documentation Report

## Task Overview
Reproduce & document current issues with the screenshot feature in the Dead Ahead Roadkill Bingo app.

## Current Status (As of Step 1)

### 1. Git Repository State
- **Current commit:** `9204a50` - "Fix Instagram API integration and aspect ratio compliance"
- **Previous commit with screenshot feature:** `ce7168b` - "Add expo-sharing dependency" (reverted from)
- **Repository:** Up to date with origin/main

### 2. App Dependencies (Current State)
The app currently **DOES NOT** have screenshot functionality implemented. Missing dependencies:
- `expo-sharing` - Not installed
- `react-native-view-shot` - Not installed

### 3. Current App State Analysis

#### GameScreen.tsx
- **Screenshot functionality:** NOT implemented
- **Victory detection:** Working correctly (logs show game events)
- **Layout:** Stable - no layout shifts observed
- **Touch interaction:** Fully functional
- **Issue:** No screenshot capture on victory

#### VictoryScreen.tsx
- **Share functionality:** Text-only sharing via clipboard
- **Animation:** Victory animations working (confetti particles)
- **Layout:** Properly rendered
- **Issue:** No screenshot sharing capability

### 4. Metro Bundler Logs (Current Session)
```
iOS Bundled 11411ms node_modules/expo-router/entry.js (1578 modules)
WARN  [expo-av]: Expo AV has been deprecated and will be removed in SDK 54
LOG  üîä Audio initialized successfully
LOG  ‚úÖ Settings loaded from storage
LOG  ‚úÖ Achievements loaded from storage
LOG  ‚úÖ Stats loaded from storage
```

**No screenshot-related errors** - because the feature is not implemented.

### 5. Game Functionality Testing

#### Current Working Features:
- ‚úÖ App loads successfully
- ‚úÖ Game board renders correctly
- ‚úÖ Touch interactions work
- ‚úÖ Victory detection works
- ‚úÖ Navigation to victory screen works
- ‚úÖ Camera functionality works
- ‚úÖ Instagram integration works
- ‚úÖ Animations work properly

#### Missing Features (Screenshot Related):
- ‚ùå No screenshot capture on victory
- ‚ùå No victory game board screenshot
- ‚ùå No visual sharing of bingo results
- ‚ùå Share button only copies text to clipboard

### 6. Next Steps for Implementation

To implement the screenshot feature, we need to:

1. **Add Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npx expo install expo-sharing react-native-view-shot
   ```

2. **Implement Screenshot Capture:**
   - Add `captureRef` functionality to GameScreen
   - Capture bingo board on victory
   - Store screenshot URI in game store

3. **Update Victory Screen:**
   - Display captured screenshot
   - Enable sharing screenshot with victory message
   - Add fallback if screenshot fails

4. **Test on Both Platforms:**
   - iOS simulator
   - Android emulator
   - Document any platform-specific issues

### 7. Known Issues to Watch For

Based on the previous implementation that was reverted:
- `RNViewShot` module registration issues
- TurboModuleRegistry errors
- Native binary linking problems
- Platform-specific screenshot capture failures

### 8. Testing Strategy

1. **Functional Testing:**
   - Play game to completion
   - Trigger victory condition
   - Observe screenshot capture process
   - Test sharing functionality

2. **Error Monitoring:**
   - Metro console for JS errors
   - iOS/Android native logs
   - Sentry error tracking (if configured)

3. **User Experience:**
   - Layout stability during capture
   - Animation timing issues
   - Loading states during sharing

## Conclusion

The current app state is stable and functional without screenshot capabilities. The screenshot feature needs to be implemented from scratch, and we should be prepared for the native module integration challenges that caused the previous revert.
